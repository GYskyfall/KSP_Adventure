# KPS_Adventure
Kerbal Space Program automatic exploration program with KRPC and Python

KSP is a wonderfull video game. The KRPC mod allow us to control the games remotely.

Here the goal of the different script is to automatize the mission as far as possible.

The scripts will be written in Python with the krpc module.

Feel free to use the scripts to learn about Python, KSP and Space. All is under GPL Licences. if you improve it please redistribute.

I use KSP 1.4.3 with Python 3.5.2 under Linux.

The bash script create_env.bash will create a pyhon's virtual environment with the relevant modules.

After created, you can type:
source krpc-env/bin/activate
to activate the virtual environment.
